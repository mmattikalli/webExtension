            Slouch Detection
        </h6>
        <p>
            Slouch Detection has a feature called ZoomAssist, where if the extension detects that 
            one is slouching, it will automatically zoom in on the contents of the webpage. 
            ZoomAssist can only be turned on when Slouch Detection is enabled, but Slouch Detection 
            will be fully functional even without the zoom feature.
